My name is John Adams. I am a front end software engineer that has a strong interest in creating fluid, effective user interactions from big picture UX/UI to micro-interactions. I strive to make a difference through my work by implementing well-written code aimed at creating accessible, meaningful, and intuitively-designed applications. Front end development provides me with the tactile experience of creating with a focus on visual aesthetics that I look for within my daily work. I currently work at Turing School of Software and Design providing 1:1 technical support to students throughout the front end program with a focus on key concepts surrounding HTML, CSS, Javascript and React. I am looking to transition into my first front end oriented development role, and I am excited to continue expanding my skills and knowledge while contributing to a team!
